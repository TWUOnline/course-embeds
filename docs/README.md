## Technical Details

This is a customized [Docsify Open Publishing Starter Kit](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-publishing-starter-kit) site which can render multiple remote Markdown files (i.e. a Markdown file in any GitHub repository).  

For example, to render a Markdown file named **README.md** (the expected default name) the URL would be https://paulhibbitts.github.io/test-docsify-project-docs/?basePath=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-course-starter-kit/main

To render a Markdown file with a name other than README.md, for example **topic-1.md**, the URL would be https://paulhibbitts.github.io/test-docsify-project-docs/?basePath=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-publishing-starter-kit/main/docs&homepage=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-publishing-starter-kit/main/docs/chapter-1/topic-1.md#/
